On cloning, use `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` to get simgrid repository.

Then use `cmake -Denable_java=ON .` to enable java.

If you are on arch like me, you need to define path to Java native libraries on the cmake command line to stop it whining about JNI :
"-DJAVA_AWT_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/libawt.so -DJAVA_JVM_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/libjava.so".

On certain jdk, you need to add something to CMakeLists.txt to make it stop complaining about some const variables :
`` SET(GCC_PERMISSIVE_FLAGS "-fpermissive")
SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS  "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${GCC_PERMISSIVE_FLAGS}") ''

On `make install`, simgrid seems to not add the correct rights to some files (no read for others)

Subject : See "spring-doc" (svn) on inria forge for all the documents.
